- Doesn't flail while debugging.
- Demonstrates knowledge of industry trends.
- Provides technical advice and weighs in on technical decisions that impact other teams or the company at large. Researches and proposes new technologies.

## Delivery

- A master of our [engineering first principles](https://github.com/TableCheck-Labs/engineering-first-principles).
- Persistent in the face of roadblocks; dispatches them efficiently, pulling in others as necessary.
- Requires minimal direction/oversight.
- Takes the initiative to fix issues before being assigned them (aka “perceiving the need”). Seeks empirical evidence through proof of concepts, tests and external research.

- End-to-end responsibility on projects of increasing complexity; contributes to common code.
- Go-to expert in one area of the codebase; understands the broad architecture of the entire system.
- Looks at test cases and advises QA on adjacent code/regression impact.
- Identifies and proactively tackles technical debt before it grows into debt that requires significant up-front work to resolve.
- Has a complete understanding of how the tasks assigned to him/her affect the clients and organizes his queue based on priority with little or no help from manager/supervisor

## Communication

- Makes others better through code review, thorough documentation, technical guidance, and mentoring or serving as a Tech Lead on a project. Acts as a force multiplier for junior and mid engineers.
- Understands the tradeoffs between technical, analytical and product needs and leads to solutions that take all of these needs into account.
- Identifies and proposes strategies around technical problems affecting their team, communicates standards and gets buy-in on solutions
- Knows who to communicate with in the organization to unblock other engineers.
- Promotes a culture of vulnerability and trust, making all engineers feel comfortable.
