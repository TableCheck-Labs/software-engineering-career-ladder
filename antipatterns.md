Often faces difficulties in effective collaboration due to limited interpersonal skills, making it challenging to build positive working relationships with colleagues. The Rain Man is a frequent trope that can understand any system without ever looking at any code.

## The Perfectionist

Strives for an unattainable level of perfection, often resulting in missed deadlines and an inability to deliver projects on time. An excessive focus on minor details can overshadow the importance of timely project completion. Can also be a bike-shedder, focusing on unnecessarily complicated abstractions while ignoring the bigger picture. **However**, the perfectionist has a necessary place in mission-critical systems that require absolute perfection in the absence of a time/budget constraint.

## The Maverick

Tends to introduce creative features independently in a solo that are not aligned with project priorities or stakeholder requirements. This leads to deviations from the intended project focus. It can be potentially disasterous if The Maverick introduces deep abstractions at this point which later features utilize, then your entire codebase becomes tighly coupled to some unknown, mysterous feature that no one understands (because there is no ticket/documentation). The Maverick can also tend to have poor charisma, instead weaponizing their toxic behavior as a way to force acquiescence to their ideas.

## The Code-Slinger

Frequently produces disorganized and poorly-structured code, making it challenging for others to maintain and collaborate on the codebase. This lack of dexterity can lead to ongoing maintenance difficulties and non-adherence to coding standards.
